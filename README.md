# evolution-simulation
This is my first OOP project, it was prepared for University.<br>
The program is supposed to simulate the life of imaginary beings called Robs on a rectangular board.<br>
Program's behaviour can be expanded or just modified by files that it reads - a board and set of parameters with values.
